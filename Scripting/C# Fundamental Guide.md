C# is the language used by the Unity Engine, and our team. All you need are some fundamentals to get started, and this document may be an effective introduction.

<h1>Language Fundamentals</h1>
The following will be universally applicable for C#; these are the first steps.
<ul>
    <li>Types</li>
    <li>Methods—invoking, creating</li>
    <li>Loops</li>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>Privacy</li>
    #### Below are more advanced topics, but still important.
    <li>Generics</li>
    <li>Class inheritance</li>
    <li>Interfaces</li>
    #### Optional, but useful
    <li>Lambdas</li>
    <li>Namespaces and using directives</li>
    
  
</ul>
<h1>Where next?</h1>
It's up to you; it's important to get these concepts, but you're the judge of that. If you want to further hone your skills, I would suggest either creating an intermediate C# program to utulize these skills — such as a simple card game, like blackjack — or just by grabbing Unity by the horns.
