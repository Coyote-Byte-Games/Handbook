Unity is difficult to learn in the same style as the prior document; there's just too much. Rather, taking things one project at a time is the best way to go. As you go along, try to pick up concepts along the way, like the use of Time.Deltatime, the Unity input system, etc.

For any assets you might need, feel free to use the Unity Asset store, there's alot of good free stuff (this is written before the idea of assets has been given any thought oops)
